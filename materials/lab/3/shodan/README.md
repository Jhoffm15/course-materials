I extended host.go it now accepts an optional page number (default 1) and it lets you request an aditional page. 
You can also make a rew request by responding with !Y when prompted then with R followed by <searchterm> (enter) <page> (enter)

just make main then use Usage: main \<searchterm\> [page]
